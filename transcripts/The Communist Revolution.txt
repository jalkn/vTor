right
ladies and gentlemen again let me say
welcome to our home
and thank you for taking the time to be
here i'm well aware that whether you're
here in person
or through the medium of motion picture
that for most of you
it's not easy to fit meetings of this
kind into your schedules
but the fact that you are here indicates
that you do have an interest in the
subject
and that means there's a tremendous
obligation on my part
to develop that subject with the kind of
usable information
that will make it worth your while so in
order not to waste any of your time
let's dispense with the usual
preliminaries and get right down to the
business at hand
the title of this presentation is more
deadly than war
but the subject matter itself is
revolution
we're going to examine in quite a bit of
detail the communist
theory and practice of revolution
particularly as applied to the united
states
now this will not be something dreamed
up out of thin air
this will be the strategy as taught by
them and advocated by them
in their own manuals in their textbooks
and in their schools
now the organization of this material
will lead to
three rather startling conclusions the
first is
that the communist program for
revolution in america
is divided into two phases violent
and non-violent the second conclusion
is that the strategy for violent
revolution
calls for chaos anarchy mass confusion
and panic among the people
a crisis in government and then out of
the vacuum
the sudden seizure of power by
communist-led guerrilla bans
the third conclusion is that the
non-violent phase of revolution
actually is more important to the
communists and more potentially
dangerous to us
now the strategy for this phase calls
for the gradual transition of our
government
into a communist regime done peacefully
and
legally but under the banner of
socialism
this then is the outline of the material
that lies ahead
so let's start right at the beginning
with conclusion number one
which is that the communist program for
revolution in america
is divided into two phases violent and
non-violent now a good place to begin
is with this communist booklet entitled
on the nature of revolution
the marxist theory of social change it
was written by herbert
one of the leading theoreticians of the
communist party in this country
and on page 11 afflicter says the
equating of violence with the nature and
process of revolution is not correct
violence may or may not appear in such a
process
and its presence or absence is not a
determining feature of the definition
now this comes as quite a surprise to
many of us because for years
we've been used to thinking of communist
revolutions only as those which involve
the overthrow of governments
by force and violence that entire phrase
has been written and spoken so often as
a single concept
that many of us haven't even considered
the possibility that the communists
might have another approach to their
goal
that they might overthrow the government
without force and violence
that they might in fact plan to come to
power through means that properly could
be called
peace and politics now in order to go
any further
it'll be necessary for us to define a
few terms
when the communists speak of the two
kinds of revolution
they don't come right out and say so in
plain english of course not
you see they claim to be practicing
something called
scientific marxism and so they have to
dress up these crude concepts
in elaborate phraseology for instance
when the communists speak of
violent revolution they describe it as a
war
of national liberation now the so-called
theory behind this
is that the people of the country marked
for takeover supposedly are an oppressed
people
they're dominated by an imperialistic
foreign power that has colonized them
and exploited them
and so the communists claim that it's
their duty
their historic duty to liberate them
from the yoke of fascism or
imperialism or colonialism or whatever
naturally the communist orientation of
the movement is played down
they prefer to identify themselves
usually as a people's army of liberation
or a national liberation front
of course this is the kind of guerrilla
warfare we've seen
used in china algeria cuba south vietnam
and many other places around the world
but there are other phrases also used to
describe the same process
occasionally they'll refer to this
violent type of revolution
as an anti-imperialist war or an
anti-colonialist war
but they all equal the same thing wars
of national liberation
anti-imperialist wars and
anti-colonialist wars
are all phrases used to describe that
aspect of communist revolution
aimed at overthrowing the government by
means of force
and violence to describe their
non-violent revolution
the communists most often use the term
proletarian
revolution but they also refer to it as
the socialist revolution
and sometimes as the anti-monopoly
struggle
but here again they all add up to the
same thing the proletarian revolution
the socialist revolution and the
anti-monopoly struggle
are all merely different ways in which
the communists describe their strategy
for
overthrowing the government through
non-violent
means well all right having defined some
of the key phrases
we can return now to the communist
literature and be able to understand
what they mean when they use these words
now in 1960 the representatives from
communist
parties all over the world gathered in
moscow and issued a joint declaration
which included this statement
our time whose main content is the
transition of capitalism to socialism
is a time of socialist revolutions and
national liberation revolutions
in other words simply stated we're
living in an era of two kinds of
revolution
one violent and the other non-violent
now here's a document published by the
communist party in this country in 1968
it's entitled the new program of the
communist party usa
a second draft and on the subject
here's what it says contemporary
revolutions bear two distinctive marks
they are socialist they are
anti-imperialist
more than a billion human beings are now
embarked on socialist revolution
a larger number is in varying stages of
revolution for
national liberation
well in order to relate this general
concept of two kinds of revolution to
the
specific application here in the united
states it'll be necessary for us to
examine
rather closely the communist position on
what they describe
as the negro question now basically
summarized
the communist position on the negro
question is as follows
as early as 1928 the communist declared
that the racial differences among our
people
constituted the weakest and most
vulnerable point in our social fabric
by constantly probing and straining at
this one spot
they calculated that eventually the
cloth could be torn apart
and that americans could be divided
weakened and perhaps even set against
each other in open combat
they said in no unmistakable terms that
the negro people because of their
secondary social status
and their predominant working-class
composition offered
greater revolutionary possibilities than
any other cross-section of the
population
to develop these possibilities the
communists proclaimed that the american
negro constituted
a separate nation within a nation
a colony within the continental borders
of the united states
the people of this nation were said to
be oppressed
and exploited by colonialist
imperialist racist america consequently
the communist party called for their
liberation
their right to self-determination to
break away from the united states
and to set up their own nation within
our borders
now to bring this about of course force
and violence must be used
a war of national liberation must be
fought
the territory designated for this nation
to be liberated
was the black belt in the south those
counties and states
in which the negro population was
dominant
when established the new nation was to
have a soviet type government
and be totally subservient to the
communist party
but and this is extremely important the
communists made it clear from the very
beginning
that they could never hope to capture
all of the united states
with a war of national liberation only
part of it
you see elsewhere in the world the
segment of the population supposedly
liberated by the communists has been a
majority segment
the peasants in china the muslims in
algeria
all the people in cuba but in the united
states
our negro population is in the minority
and even if the communists should be
successful in creating
similar liberation movements among other
segments of our people
as they're trying to do for instance
among mexican americans puerto ricans
and even american indians even if they
should succeed and then
amalgamate all of these together into
one large liberation movement
it still adds up to a minority of the
total population
and the communists are not stupid they
realize that revolution of force and
violence dependent upon a minority
is doomed to ultimate failure except in
those areas
where they actually do constitute a
majority but they aren't going to settle
for just part of the united states
they want all of it and so they made it
clear long ago
that their violent war of national
liberation must be secondary
to the non-violent proletarian
revolution
to take the united states all of the
united states
it'll be necessary they say to involve
white people
as well as black to create a broad
coalition
a revolutionary link between the civil
rights movement
organized labor peace groups student
dissidents
and in general to escalate their
revolution in america from
race war to class war
now this in a nutshell is the communist
position
on the negro question let's turn now to
the record and see how the communists
themselves explain it
now this communist booklet entitled
american negro problems
was published in nineteen twenty eight
it was written by
john pepper alias joseph pagani now
pagani was sent to this country
as the personal envoy of joseph stalin
and his specific mission
was to bring the american communist
party into line with the policies and
directives from moscow
particularly with regard to the negro
question and
here is what pagani said
the communist party of america in its
fight against imperialism
must recognize clearly the tremendous
revolutionary possibilities
of the liberation movement of the negro
people it is the basic duty of the
communist party
to develop all revolutionary
possibilities of the negro race
the black belt in the south constitutes
virtually
a colony within the body of the united
states of america
self-determination means the right to
establish their own state
to erect their own government if they
choose to do so
the communist party of america must come
out openly and unreservedly
for the right of national
self-determination for the negroes
but it would be a major mistake to
believe that there can be any other
revolution in imperialist america
than a proletarian revolution
let me repeat that last sentence because
it's the key to this entire presentation
it would be a major mistake to believe
that there can be any other revolution
in imperialist america than a
proletarian
revolution well moving forward to the
year 1935
we come to this communist booklet
entitled the negroes in the soviet
america
written by james ford and james allen
beginning on page 24 the general
strategy is laid out in rather
graphic form you see there's a major
heading here
entitled the negro and revolution
directly beneath this there's a
subheading entitled
two revolutions in one and then within
this section
it says the problem of negro liberation
has two aspects we shall first consider
each separately
and then show how the solution for the
first flows into
the solution for the second now the next
subheading then is entitled
the rebellion of an oppressed nation and
the section that follows that describes
the
violent revolution that must be fought
to liberate the black belt of the south
then finally over the next page there's
another subheading entitled
the proletarian revolution and here
we begin to get an idea finally of what
this phase of the revolution is all
about
it says capitalism is decaying
it is an outworn system capitalism is
based upon the private ownership of
machines
factories railroads land and all other
means of production
only one thing can do away with the
basis for the existence of capitalism
the expropriation of the capitalists
and by the way i'm sure you realize that
everyone here
by communist definition at least is a
capitalist
so you should feel good to know that
there are those who are planning your
expropriation someday in order to
expropriate the capitalists
the workers first need to discard the
existing government machinery
and to institute a working class
government
under this new workers government the
building
of socialism begins
now exactly what that's all about the
building of socialism we'll get to in a
moment
but finally on page 28 under the third
subheading entitled
the combination of two revolutions the
communists reveal how the two phases of
the revolution are related to each other
and which of the two is most important
to them
between the proletarian revolution and
the revolution of the negro people
there is a living link this is the
working class
here reposes the leadership of the two
aspects of the revolution
but the negro communist is first and
foremost
the exponent of the proletarian
revolution
well 1935 is a long time ago
and sometimes we hear it said that the
communists have since
abandoned this concept but ladies and
gentlemen
they cannot abandon it for the simple
reason that if they did so
they'd be abandoning the classic dual
form of revolution dictated by
marxism leninism they'd cease to be
communists
to justify violence they have to be able
to claim that they're liberating people
and if people are to be liberated then
it's necessary to go through the motions
at least
of pretending that they have a right to
form a nation of their own
and so the communist position on the
negro question today
is no different than it was back in
nineteen twenty eight
now political affairs is the official
monthly magazine of the communist party
in this country
the date on this particular issue is
november 1968
the feature article for that month was
the right
of black america to create a nation
written by
communist theoretician claude lightfoot
now lightfoot points out that many years
of migration of negroes into the north
and of caucasians into the south have
altered the population statistics to the
point
where the black belt is considerably
smaller today than it was when the
communist
position on the negro question was first
drafted therefore he says
the concept of a negro nation must not
necessarily be restricted to just
one large territory in the south but
must be expanded now to include
the so-called ghetto areas in the north
so having updated the basic strategy to
reflect
present realities he then repeats the
same old communist line
on page nine he says
we should call for a plebiscite of all
black americans
on whether they want to remain in the
general commonwealth or to establish
another nation within the continental
united states
thus the slogan of self-determination
today means the struggle for the right
of black america
to form a nation if it elects to do so
now in passing ladies and gentlemen you
may have wondered
why the communist party has been a
staunch supporter of the drive to place
a black
studies curriculum into our high schools
and colleges
well the reason becomes obvious the
minute you take a look at the textbooks
and the study guides
the net effect of these courses on the
students who enroll
is to create a consciousness of nation
by stressing the historical and cultural
differences between our black and white
citizens
instead of the similarities the
predictable impact upon the student
is such that he'll view the communist
call for a separate nation
with far more acceptance than his
parents did
under the guise of academic balance
these courses have become a brilliant
device
for conditioning young people to accept
still one more part
of the total program for revolution
but returning once again to claude
lightfoot
after having called for a separate
nation he then repeats the ever
important point
that as important as the national
liberation movement may be
it still must be secondary in importance
to the non-violent
peaceful transition to communism called
the socialist revolution
he says from this it follows that the
advocates of a black nation
must identify themselves with all that
is required to set up a socialist
america
recognizing that black people alone
could never destroy
capitalism to digress again for just a
moment
i'd like to point out that this concept
of two kinds of revolution
is really the basis for that much
publicized split between moscow and p
king the moscow group says there are two
kinds of revolution
violent and non-violent we believe in
using either or both depending on which
combination
proves to be the most effective but as
true marxist leninists
we believe that the gradual non-violent
approach
is more effective in today's modern
world to which the peking group shout
and reply
heresy heresy true there are two kinds
of revolution
and we think to practice either or both
but we are the true marxist leninists
for we believe that the quick violent
approach is more effective
in today's modern world and there's the
total difference between the two
factions of world communism
each claims to be more correct in its
interpretation
of classical communist strategy but as
far as the united states is concerned
you can be sure that it makes precious
little difference
both types of revolution are being used
against us today
both are enhanced by the presence of the
other and both
lead to exactly the same destination
all right let's move along now to the
second conclusion
the strategy for violent revolution in
america
calls for chaos anarchy destruction
a crisis in government mass confusion
and panic among the people
and then out of the vacuum the sudden
seizure of power by communist-led
guerrilla bands
now this is the kind of activity the
overthrow of government by force and
violence
that most people think of when they
speak about communist revolutions
so there's no need to belabor the point
but i'm going to take just a moment
to show the extent to which the
communists actually are planning to use
this kind of revolution
against the united states now this is
not so well known
now here is a book that i think ought to
be in
every home library it's entitled color
communism and common sense by manning
johnson
now as you can see from his photograph
manning johnson
was a negro he was also a member of the
communist party
he joined the party as a young man
because he honestly believed
that the communists were trying to
improve the conditions of his people
he was a dedicated communist and
eventually he rose to one of the highest
ranks
he was appointed to the national negro
commission
of the communist party usa but after
many years
manning johnson finally came to the
realization that the communists weren't
the least bit interested in improving
the conditions of the negro people
he discovered that instead they were
merely planning to use his people
and these are his words to use them as
cannon fodder
in a bloody revolution to destroy
america
and when he woke up to this he dropped
out of the party
and devoted the rest of his life trying
to alert his fellow citizens of all
races
to the true nature of the communist
party as he knew it to be from the
inside
and this book contains much of that
story
i wish i had the time to examine the
entire volume with you page by page but
here at least is one short quotation
that
pertains to the immediate topic manning
johnson said
black rebellion was what moscow wanted
bloody racial conflict would split
america
during the confusion demoralization and
panic would set in
then finally the reds say now at this
point he quotes verbatim
from a communist directive that he
studied while inside the party
workers stop work many of them seize
arms by attacking arsenal's
street fights become frequent under the
leadership of the communist party
the workers organize revolutionary
committees to be in command of the
uprising
armed workers seize the principal
government offices
invade the residences of the president
and his cabinet members
arrest them declare the old regime
abolished establish their own
power
now here is a piece of vicious communist
propaganda that perhaps
some of you have seen it's called the
crusader
it's published periodically in red china
and is widely circulated through the
negro communities here in america
it's written by robert f williams
one of the organizers of the
revolutionary action movement
better known as ram williams also was
the president of the local chapter of
the naacp in monroe north carolina
at that time needless to say he wasn't
telling very many people that he was
also
a member of the communist party and one
day back in 1961
he decided to start a small war of
national liberation of his own
apparently he was too impatient to wait
for the big signal so finally to
avoid prosecution for assault with a
deadly weapon
and for kidnapping he fled to cuba and
then to read china
where he now writes communist propaganda
one other thing you should know about
robert williams is that recently he was
elected by members of snick
core ram the naacp and similar groups
as the president in exile of something
called the republic of new africa
following the communist line in every
detail these men
claim that they're the representatives
of a new government and a new nation
within the continental borders of the
united states
they issued a demand to the state
department that a large segment of land
be turned over to them as their rightful
territory
the proclamation said that they're now
prepared to negotiate
in good faith the peaceful transfer to
them
of the southern portion of the united
states the implication being of course
that
if they don't get it peacefully then
they'll just have to take it
by force and violence already the
republic of new africa has established a
central headquarters in mississippi
and its leaders in the north are
actively recruiting a black panther
guerrilla force
and what they call a revolutionary
freedom
corps the rfc from among black militant
students
to act as organizers and to set up local
provisional governments as they call
them in the so-called ghetto areas
but the reason i've mentioned all this
is merely to introduce properly
one robert f williams the president in
exile of this
republic of new africa and the author of
the crusader
now here is what robert williams says
the lifeblood of u s capitalism is its
productive capacity
and its extensive commerce if these two
factors were to become paralyzed and
rendered sterile
the orderly function of the government
establishment would degenerate
into a state of chaos and the
superstructure of the system would
collapse
the more automated a society is the more
vulnerable it is
to forces of calamity what would highly
mechanized america be without
electrical power what would it be
without modern transportation
what would it be without its industrial
capacity
then having asked these questions robert
williams
proceeds to explain in minute detail
exactly how to manufacture the devices
that can be used by a mere handful of
people to ensure that highly automated
america
will lose its electrical power its
modern transportation
and its industrial capacity i can assure
you ladies and gentlemen
that less than a dozen people if they
know what they're doing
can reduce any of our major cities into
a helpless seething massive confusion
panic and death just one person
one person can poison the city's entire
water supply
or destroy the main aqueduct or blow up
the principal pumping stations
and why would people in los angeles for
instance get a drink of water
if it didn't come out of a pipe and how
long can a human being survive without
water
four or five days perhaps long before
that
there'd be tens of thousands of people
dead in our cities
not from thirst but because they were
unable to defend what water they had
from roving bands of desperate people
who were dying of thirst
and that's thinking only of the loss of
water in your mind's eye
compound that with no food no
electricity
no way to dispose of sewage no police
protection
no water pressure to fight fires no
radio or tv no telephone no buses no
gasoline for your car
no way to escape no place to go if you
could
don't think for a minute that the
countryside would be immune from
disaster either
in this issue of the crusader the
communist call not only for extensive
chaos within the cities
but for putting to the torch every
village every forest every field and
every barn
the plan is for raging fires from one
city to the next
the reason well first there's the value
of sheer destruction
secondly it would force us to deploy our
defenses and rescue units over the
widest possible area
the communists point out that as long as
our police and national guard remain
concentrated they're invincible but if
they can be forced to spread out
over the entire city and into the
countryside as well
then they can be picked off from ambush
one by one
and the third value of massive fire to
the communists
is psychological the average american
they say
soft and decadent when he sees billows
of black smoke
rising from one horizon to the other
when at night the only light he has to
see by is the flickering red from flames
leaping into the sky
he'll become paralyzed with fear and
panic he'll run away and hide
and do nothing to interfere with the
gorilla bands as they strike at the
community's power centers
the crusader explains how to set up
sniper units in crowded metropolitan
areas
how to manufacture jumbo molotov
cocktails
the gallon jug size and how to mix the
gasoline with certain ingredients
to make it burn like napalm how to pour
gasoline into utility manholes in the
streets to set fire to the main
telephone cables
how to put sulfur tips from matches into
air conditioning units
and blow up large buildings how to
ignite gas mains and oil storage tanks
it explains how radio controlled model
airplanes
can be used to fly explosive heavily
guarded fences
into gasoline storage areas or munition
stockpiles
it even calls for infiltration into the
national guard units
revolutionaries posing as non-militants
for the purpose of getting free military
training and for gaining access to
critical military supplies
and heavy weapons and then finally
robert williams says this
any all-out minority revolution must
create a state of crisis
wherein almost all of the male
population would be forced to remain in
their homes
to protect their property and families
the middle class is very large but it is
not accustomed to deprivation
and terror because of its affluence it
has waxed
soft it has no stomach for massive fire
blood and violence the motive force
behind its life drive
is its endless pursuit of prestige
conspicuous consumption
and sensual pleasure a few years
of violent sporadic and highly
destructive uprisings
will set the stage for the grand finale
after the stage is properly set
through protracted struggle america
could be brought to her knees in 90 days
of highly organized fierce fighting
sabotage
and massive firestorm
now ladies and gentlemen no evaluation
would be complete
if we fail to note that the communist
blueprint
calls also for white retaliation and
violence
in the black communities it's a very
important objective
for the communist party so far
they've only been able to involve a
small percentage of our negro people in
this
war of national liberation the great
majority want no part of it in any form
but the one sure way to change that is
to have
white vigilante groups striking into the
negro sections supposedly
to seek revenge we mustn't get ourselves
into thinking
that the communists have placed their
agitators only into the black
communities
they're working both sides of the street
they want hatred
violence and bloodshed between the races
and they don't care how they get it or
whom they use
even children if necessary part of the
plan
calls for commando squads of black
revolutionaries
to drive into the white residential
areas and shoot
little children playing on the sidewalks
for the sole purpose of drawing
out of the white communities violent
retaliation into the black communities
now this is extremely important to the
communists they must have it
for in this way they plan to unite the
entire negro population for protection
behind the militant minority
it's not a very pretty picture but it's
one we need to understand
so that no matter what happens to us or
to our families
god willing will have the strength at
least to avoid doing anything
that would play further into the hands
of the communists
ladies and gentlemen the plans and
preparations
for a communist revolution of force and
violence are far advanced
the organization behind these
preparations has almost
unlimited financial resources and it
provides both
training and leadership based upon years
of experience
in many other countries our enemies are
deadly serious about their task
and it's nothing short of national
suicide for us to continue to ignore
their plans
and their progress all right having said
this
now i'm going to qualify it somewhat by
turning to
conclusion number three
as important as the strategy for violent
revolution
is and it certainly cannot be
overstressed
nevertheless the strategy for
non-violent revolution
is even more important to the communists
and more potentially fatal to us
so let's turn next to that part of the
total picture
ladies and gentlemen as pointed out
previously the communists can never hope
to come to power over the entire united
states
through a so-called war of national
liberation of a minority population
they can capture a large portion of it
and they can create an awful lot of
chaos and destruction everywhere else
but to take the country as a whole
will require an entirely different
approach
the violent revolution becomes a primary
value to the communists
to the extent to which it can be used to
condition the masses psychologically
to accept the non-violent revolution
which is offered supposedly as the only
alternative
hoping to avoid further violence and
bloodshed
the public is to be pressured into
accepting measures
that will move the country gradually and
legally
toward communism but without calling it
that
the strategy of the proletarian
revolution
calls for the quiet conversion of our
government into a communist regime
but under the banner of socialism
well what is socialism all right let's
define it
according to the dictionary socialism is
a political concept
based upon the principle of government
ownership and control
of property the means of production and
the avenues of commerce
but the important thing as far as this
presentation is concerned
is how do the communists define it and
this is where many people are surprised
to learn
that the communists have an entirely
different meaning for the word socialism
than the average american has did you
know that there isn't a single communist
country in existence
anywhere on earth that's right not one
russia isn't a communist country red
china isn't
cuba certainly isn't these are socialist
lands that's how communist leaders
always describe them
you see according to the teachings of
karl marx
communism will come to this world only
in some
future utopian era when men will have
learned to live together in perfect
harmony
when they'll no longer be greedy or
competitive when they'll want to share
equally with their fellow
human beings and have nothing better
than anyone else
when this comes to pass there will no
longer be any need for
police or for government of any kind
and then he said the state will wither
away
when that happens said marx it will be
communism
in the meantime comrades whenever we
come to power
we shall call it socialism
so the next time you hear a communist
spokesman stand before a college
audience or a tv camera
and say innocently that all the
communists are doing here in america
is working for socialism you must
understand what he means by that word
what he's really saying is all the
communists are doing
is trying to bring to america exactly
the same thing they now have in the
soviet union and red
china now they can call that socialism
if they want to
but most americans i think would
describe that over there
as communism
the new program of the communist party
on this subject has this to say
the term socialism describes but the
first stage of a new society
that in its full development is called
communism
socialism is a transitional stage
well the important question though is
why do the communists promote socialism
is it merely because they honestly
believe that it's a necessary
transitional stage
to some higher more perfect form of
society
i don't think so i doubt very much if
the communist leaders
believe their own fairy tale and i'm
sure they're not so naive is to believe
that their present
super state is ever really going to
wither away
but they promote socialism just the same
because they know that socialism
by definition means control
over people if the government owns and
controls
all property all means a production and
all avenues of commerce
then it controls all people
if we're dependent upon the government
for our food our clothing
our shelter our jobs our medical care
then we're far more effectively
controlled by those who hold political
power
than if they stood over us with soldiers
and weapons
some years ago i happened to attend a
meeting where several
anti-communist refugees from behind the
iron curtain were called upon to relate
their personal experiences
some of the questions that came from the
audience were rather naive i suppose
because
finally one of the refugees spoke up and
he said
you know you americans have funny ideas
about
life under communism apparently you
think there's a communist soldier
standing on every street corner with a
rifle and bayonet to keep the people in
line
but this isn't so he said oh sure in the
beginning there were plenty of soldiers
and executions and deportations to slave
labor camps but we don't see much of
that anymore
the open violence lasted only for about
a year or a year and a half
and then the anti-communist leadership
was liquidated
and now to the casual observers there's
a great deal of apparent
calm and freedom for instance he said
i lived in the largest city in the
country we had a large park there
directly across the street from a
beautiful church
he said they left one church open one in
the entire country
primarily for guided tours of visiting
americans
who had come to see if religion was
being persecuted
he said anytime i wanted to
i could have gone into that park stood
on a bench and spoken out against
communism
then i could have walked across the
street into that church and knelt down
in prayer
and i wouldn't have been arrested or
bothered in any way
but you can be sure i did not do these
things
because if i had the very next day
the wheels of the bureaucracy would have
begun to turn
and i would have been informed that my
quota of food stamps had been cut
that my allotment for clothing and shoes
had been reduced that my allocation for
living quarters had been downgraded
and finally that my job assignment had
been changed from the kind of work for
which i'd been trained
to menial labor at lower pay
so none of us did any of those things
that we were theoretically entitled to
do
because of the tremendous power that the
communist party had
over our economic existence
and then he said something that i'll
never forget he hesitated for a moment
and weighing his words very carefully so
as not to hurt our feelings
he said you know i came to america
expecting to find a nation of free men
but instead i find exactly the same
thing
everywhere i look i see men and women
who know that communists
are making headway in this country they
know that something must be done
and that someone must stand up to them
but they themselves
do nothing they remain silent
because they're afraid that if they
speak out
or take a stand publicly
it'll be bad for business they may lose
a client
they may even lose their jobs
or perhaps they're receiving a regular
government check
and already are too dependent upon some
of the very people
and programs they know they should
oppose
and then he said these men
voluntarily have gone behind the iron
curtain
they're already taken over by the
communists
the only difference is that for the
present at least
they can still get out anytime they
really want to
we could not i think there's a great
lesson to be learned from that because
it's true isn't it there are many men
who are physically brave beyond any
question when it comes to standing up
against a tyranny that threatens with
armies
some of them carry the actual scars of
battle to prove it but when it comes to
this new kind of war
they're lost to the fight when there is
no battlefield
when the weapons are not rifles or bombs
but economic pressures
then who is your enemy how do you fight
where do you begin
it's precisely for these reasons that
any modern dictatorship
must have control over the economic
sphere of all human activity
this was true of nazism it was true of
fascism
it's true of communism and it's also
true of
socialism regardless of what name we
give it
total government control is by
definition
totalitarianism that's what the word
means
now leon trotsky as you recall was one
of the original bolsheviks who led the
communist revolution in russia
in 1937 trotsky wrote a book entitled
the revolution betrayed and in this book
here's what he said
the basis of bureaucratic rule is the
poverty of society
in objects of consumption when there is
enough goods in a store the purchasers
can come whenever they want to
when there is little goods the
purchasers are compelled to stand in
line
when the lines are very long it's
necessary to appoint a policeman to keep
order
such is the starting point of the power
of the soviet bureaucracy
it knows who is to get something
and who has to wait
and ladies and gentlemen there's no
better description than that
of why the communists work to promote
socialism
no matter whose definition you use under
socialism
those who run the government and the
communists are confident
that in america they eventually will be
the ones who do so
those who run the government will know
who is to get something and who has to
wait
and that represents control over human
beings
what is all this to do with the
communist revolution in america
well ladies and gentlemen it has
everything to do with it
because the building of socialism is the
communist revolution in america
it represents the process whereby our
country can be moved
gradually toward communism without the
people even being aware of it
no matter what grievance we may have
real or imagined
no matter what national problems we may
face the communists
seize upon these as excuses to build
socialism
they have one and only one solution for
all problems
more government more government and then
more and more until its total government
and forgive me for saying it one more
time total
government is communism
again let's turn to the record
shortly after the watts riot in 1965
the communist party brought out this
pamphlet entitled
the what's up surge a communist
appraisal
and here is what it said
the challenge of the watts explosion can
be met only by a truly
massive program a vast increase in the
investments in the war against poverty
program
what is called for is not only a total
economic opportunity program
for wiping out unemployment and for
proper job training
but a program for the total
reconstruction of the area
now the people's world the official west
coast newspaper of the communist party
in its august 28 1965 issue
ran this rather interesting editorial
what is needed now is an effort that
begins to approximate
the magnitude of the problem as a
minimum
such a program should demand massive
emergency action
by the federal government
well then six months later after this
particular article
the communist party came out with this
it's called the new program of the
communist party
but this was the first draft published
in 1966
and here's what it said we favor
full use of federal powers to achieve
these objectives now as i read this
uh listen carefully to see if it doesn't
sound familiar
perhaps like something you've heard from
more respectable sources
government assumption of responsibility
for assuring a guaranteed annual wage
complete cradle to the grave social
insurance coverage including
all medical care equal educational
opportunities for all with acceptance
of the principle of student stipends a
national
reconstruction plan to end ghettos and
slums
and provide the nation with a modern
rapid transit system
operated as a public service and passage
of a national youth act
that will ensure education vocational
training
and employment at decent wages for the
younger generation
does that sound familiar well
ladies and gentlemen if it reminds you
somewhat of the great society
it's because it is the great society
lock stock and barrel gus hall
head of the communist party explained it
this way
this is the january 24 1965 issue of the
worker and gus hall said
the communist attitude toward the great
society can be summarized in an old
saying
that two men sleeping in the same bed
can have different
dreams we communists support every
measure of the great society concept
because we dream of socialism
and when you recall what gus hall means
when he says
socialism then you realize
that the communists support the welfare
programs of the great society
the new deal the new frontier or
whatever they decide to call it in the
future
because they dream of bringing communism
to america
through these programs
the next question of importance is how
do the communists promote socialism
certainly it takes far more than a mere
declaration of intent more than writing
a few books
how can they bring it off especially
when there are so few of them
how can they manipulate the vast
majority into accepting socialism
when they really don't want it well here
again we find that they have a plan
the strategy is precise and well tested
it's called revolutionary
parliamentarianism
the general strategy employed is a
political
pincers movement and these are the terms
the communists use to describe it
a pincers movement applying political
pressure
from above and from below
now when they talk about pressure from
above they mean using their people
and their influence within the very
government mark for takeover
to bring forward official
recommendations for legislation
these come from the highest possible
levels and carried the full prestige of
the
the recommendations of course are
offered supposedly as solutions to
national problems
but when passed into law their only real
effect
is to vastly increase the power of
government and to move the country
that much closer toward the ultimate
goal
the pressure from below then involves
using their influence over the various
mass
membership organizations of the country
to create the appearance of great
popular support
for these recommendations of course the
members of those organizations
must never suspect that they're being
used to promote the communist program
now the silent majority the average
person with no particular axe to grind
is caught right in the middle he looks
above
and sees highly respected spokesman for
government calling for socialist
legislation
he looks below and sees mobs of
demonstrators
shouting for the same thing he says to
himself has everyone gone crazy or is it
me
now he's still in the majority of course
but he doesn't know it
he thinks he's helplessly outnumbered
and he bows to what he thinks
is the democratic will of the majority
all that remains then is for the duly
elected legislators to place their own
careers and political expediency above
the best interests of the nation
to yield to this political pressure and
pass the legislation
into law then the whole process starts
all over again
with new recommendations from above new
demands from below
and finally new capitulation in the
halls of congress
in this way the nation can move to the
left in
giant strides until the ultimate goal of
communism itself
is reached entirely legally through the
constitutional process
and in the name of the nation
now this government pamphlet entitled
the new role of national legislative
bodies in the communist conspiracy
is a reprint of two chapters taken from
a communist textbook
used in czechoslovakia it was written by
jan kozak the historian and theoretician
of the czechoslovakian communist party
this is one of the manuals used to teach
communist cadre
how the tactic of revolutionary
parliamentarianism
was used successfully in czechoslovakia
and how it might be
applied to other countries as well so
as i read this even though kozak is
speaking of how they did it in
czechoslovakia think in terms of how the
same strategy
might be used or perhaps is being used
right here in america kozak said
the pressure from above successfully
employed by our workers class
was the use made of the organs holding
powers
the government parliament national
committees
for bringing about a wide popularization
of revolutionary demands and slogans
the fact that such demands and
recommendations emanated directly from
the highest state organs
had a strong influence on their
popularization
whereas pressure from above is the
pressure exerted by the organs of the
state
pressure from below is the pressure
exerted by the popular masses
the united mass organizations which were
led an
influence to a large extent by the
communists represented in this way
the direct reserves of the party
all the all proven forms of the struggle
were employed
calling of protest meetings passing of
resolutions
sending of delegations organizing mass
demonstrations
and also eventually using strikes
including
general strikes the pressure from below
made it impossible for the other parties
which had numerical superiority
to isolate the communists and to stop
the revolution
thus it made up for the numerical
weakness of the revolutionary
representatives
progress toward socialism may take under
these circumstances
a democratic and constitutional course
all the changes which in their entirety
represent a revolutionary transformation
of the capitalist society into a
socialist one
will proceed absolutely legally
and in the name of the nation
is it possible do you suppose that
revolutionary parliamentarianism
is being used against america today is
there any evidence of this kind of
pressure from above
well ladies and gentlemen all you have
to do to answer that question
is read some of the official reports and
recommendations
that have been pouring out in a steady
stream for years
from the bureau's special agencies and
commissions of the federal government
consider for example just those reports
issued by the various
presidents commissions the president's
commission on automation
the president's commission on crime the
president's commission on civil rights
to name just a few
now this is perhaps the most classic
recent example
it's the report of the president's
national advisory commission on civil
disorders
better known as the kerner report
released to the public
in march of nineteen sixty eight have
you read this
it's incredible the list of
recommendations
supposedly to remove the causes of civil
disorders in america
reads almost identical to the new
program of the communist party
and that's not much of an exaggeration
either it calls for the vast expansion
of
all welfare programs and agencies it
suggests absorbing
all city county and state welfare
programs into one gigantic
federal welfare program and why have
state socialism
when you can have national socialism it
calls for a
government guaranteed minimum wage it
calls for federal financing and control
of every conceivable sphere of human
activity
education housing transportation even
insurance policies
it calls for strict gun control laws and
even recommends the creation of a
national police force
naturally it doesn't call it that by
name it refers to it
as the national law enforcement center
but there's no doubt as to what its
ultimate form will be especially since
it's to operate in conjunction
with the defense department but the most
incredible thing about this report i
think is not the list of recommendations
that's almost expected from groups of
this kind nowadays
the real shocker lies in its findings
the discoveries it made here was a body
of men
highly respected with the prestige and
financial resources of the federal
government at their disposal
their task was to uncover all of the
causes of civil disorders in our land
and to do so impartially with favor or
malice to no one
let the chips fall where they may now
would you suppose
that the communist party played some
tiny microscopic
role in the riots the campus disorders
the assaults against police well you're
mistaken
just because the leaders of these
revolutionary movements carry the
vietcong flag
pay homage to chi guevara travel
frequently to moscow and p
king preach against capitalism promote
the building of socialism
follow the communist line without
deviation and move in
perfect unison in every major city that
doesn't prove anything
according to the kerner report the
communists are playing
absolutely no role at all
civil disorders look it up in the index
here's a book with over 600 pages of
fine print
dealing with all of the causes of civil
turmoil
and the words communism or communist art
found
even once
not even to say that they looked into it
and found it not to be an important
factor
which is the expected cliche today
apparently the internal threat of
communism
is no longer even worth looking into
but what about the other half of the
pincers is there any evidence of
pressure from below
well consider the nature of such things
as
the mass action tactics of the selma
march of 1965
the various peace marches and civil
rights marches held in almost every
major city in the intervening years
the poor people's campaign and
resurrection city what are these
do they truly represent an expression of
the majority of americans
or are they merely well organized
pressure groups
putting on an impressive show to create
the illusion of vast popular support
and what effect does this have on
congress every time there's a new show
of strength
doesn't congress buckle under the
political pressure
and pass into law the recommendations
previously made by some
commission or agency of the federal
government and hasn't the silent
majority
been caught between these pincers and
hasn't the country been taking giant
strides to the left
through our constitutional process and
in the name of the nation
the entire process was best described i
think by martin luther king
he wrote an article for saturday review
which appeared in the april
third 1965 issue and here is how he
described it
the goal of the demonstrations in selma
as elsewhere
is to dramatize the existence of
injustice
and to bring about the presence of
justice by means of
non-violence long years of experience
indicate to us that negroes can achieve
this goal when four things occur
one non-violent demonstrators go into
the streets to exercise their
constitutional rights
two racists resist by unleashing
violence against them
three americans of conscience in the
name of decency
demand federal intervention and
legislation
and four the administration under mass
pressure initiates measures of immediate
intervention
and remedial legislation
and that ladies and gentlemen is a
perfect description
of how pressure from below is being used
in america today
to further the non-violent proletarian
revolution you know it always bothers me
when i have to agree with the communists
it doesn't happen very often but every
once in a while
i'll read something in the communist
press that is 100
correct it comes out in their favor even
without their having to lie about it
and here's an example in the people's
world the january 29 1966 issue
the communists said the problem
is that the power structure that runs
both of the old political parties
seems to have great difficulty in
comprehending what is taking place
in the negro freedom movement they don't
know a revolution
when they see one and all i can say to
that is amen they sure don't
they call it everything under the sun
except a revolution
and they're the same people by and large
who still tell you
it can't happen here
ladies and gentlemen not only can it
happen here
not only is it happening here but it
has been happening here for years
the problem is that most of us haven't
been able to recognize a revolution
in all of its forms when we saw one
well all right so what do we do about it
what are the counter measures that need
to be taken and where do we begin
we begin by knowing what not to do
because if we do the wrong things
obviously that's worse than doing
nothing at all
for example as i'm sure everyone here is
well aware
we must not be led into placing the
blame for the riots
the civil disorders on the negro people
of our nation
even those few who are promoting hatred
and violence in the black communities
are not themselves the cause they're
merely being used by
forces far bigger than they are to
promote the violent
phase of the revolution in america just
as many white people are being used i
might add by those same forces
to promote the non-violent phase
secondly and this too almost goes
without saying
we mustn't resort to violence either as
a means of furthering political or
social goals
and we must do everything humanly
possible to discourage
others from doing so third
we must not be fooled into thinking that
the causes of our civil turmoil
are such things as poverty poor housing
lack of education and similar social or
economic factors
as a matter of fact most of today's
self-styled revolutionaries
black and white come from good homes
could earn better than average incomes
if they wanted to work
and in fact their products are some of
the finest institutions of higher
learning
we shouldn't be indifferent to the
social and economic conditions of those
in need
and we should do all we can within the
concepts of economic and political
freedom
to improve those conditions but let's
not kid ourselves into thinking
that these are the causes of our
national problems today
fourth we must not look to the expansion
of government
and government programs as the solution
as i hope i've made it clear by now
this is exactly what the communists want
us to do because it's the very process
whereby they hope to come to power in
this country
through non-violent means
these are the things we must not do what
then does that leave
on the positive side well first of all
and perhaps most obvious of all we must
support
our local police but that means a lot
more than just putting a bumper sticker
on the car
it means taking an active interest in
civic affairs to ensure that the police
aren't settled with so-called
civilian review boards nothing can be
quite so
damaging to police morale and efficiency
as converting every arrest into a trial
of the policeman
instead of the criminal to support your
local police
also means making sure they remain
independent of control from washington
and don't forget whatever the federal
government finances
today it shall control
tomorrow next on the list
we must recapture the american faith in
the free enterprise system
capitalism has become almost a dirty
word in some places
mainly because its defenders were busy
enjoying the fruits of capitalism
while its enemies were busy writing
books and giving lectures
consequently capitalism has retreated
steadily before the onslaught of
socialism
and now is struggling for its very
existence young
and old we must become students again
and study the theories of madison and
jefferson
bastion and von mises just as intently
as our enemies pursue the pages of marx
and lenin
galbraith and keynes not only must we
become grounded in theory
but we must become advocates and
spokesmen as well
we must know what we stand for as well
as what we oppose
next and this is probably the most
difficult task of all
we must carry this message regarding the
dual nature of communist revolution
to our friends our neighbors our
business associates
and everyone who will listen now this is
hard by and large because people don't
want to hear it
it's bad news it spoils makes the part
he's possible and that means accepting
our personal responsibility to do
everything we humanly can do to carry
the truth
about civil turmoil to every man woman
and child
in america now ladies and gentlemen
none of these proposals will produce
results
and nothing else you may suggest will do
so either unless
and until we get right down to the heart
of the problem
the life force of the revolution itself
we must discover the identity of those
individuals both above and below
who consciously are furthering the
communist program for revolution
and then remove them from their
positions of
trust and leadership anything less than
that
will be totally futile because we'll
merely be running around
trying to put out one or two fires over
here while they're busy setting ten new
ones over there
now of course the minute you begin to
think along these lines
you'll become the target of a whole
barrage of attacks
you'll be called a witch hunter a
mccarthyite a right-wing extremist
and other delicate phrases that are well
designed to intimidate the average
person into silence
if that doesn't work then you'll be
called a fascist
or at least a dictator because
supposedly
you want to deny basic constitutional
freedoms
to a small group of americans just
because they happen to hold political
views that are different from yours
how many times have you heard that and
you know at first it sounds almost
convincing but the argument is a trap
and the bait inside that trap is the
hidden assertion
that the communist party is merely a
political party
now if it were a political party and
that's all then of course
we would have to grant them all the same
constitutional rights and immunities
as other loyal american citizens
but if the communist party is not a
political party
if it is in fact a supranational
organization
dedicated to world conquest if in
addition to political means
it also uses military means economic
means
propaganda means bribery blackmail
treason
murder and any other means that suit its
purposes
then its members are not political by
nature are
not loyal to the united states and have
no legal or moral claim
to constitutional liberties
there's no such thing as absolute
freedom
for every liberty and equal and opposite
restraint
is required for example
in order for us to enjoy freedom of
speech it's necessary to deny
others the freedom to come in here and
break up this meeting
the logic of liberty is that it must
stop
short of the liberty to destroy itself
and if we're to preserve the freedoms we
cherish in this land
then we mustn't be tricked by clever
propagandists
into giving the communist party the
freedom it seeks
to destroy freedom for us all
well now ladies and gentlemen i'm going
to close this presentation
with two observations that i know
you may not want to hear but they must
be made nevertheless
the first is that this struggle in which
we're now engaged
in a very real sense is
more deadly than war call it what you
will
cold war revolution struggle whatever
the present stakes are higher than in
any other war we've ever known after all
why do we dread war
well there are three reasons death
destruction and human suffering
but ladies and gentlemen if communism
should ever come to america
we'll face more death destruction
and human suffering than any people in
history has ever faced
at the hands of their invading
conquerors
and it would make no difference whether
the road to communism were traveled
violently or non-violently
the so-called expropriation of the
capitalists that would lie at the end of
that road
would constitute one of the greatest
bloodbaths of history
now the second observation is related to
the first
it is simply that we have now passed the
point of painless solutions
and parlor patriotism there was a time
and not too long ago i think when we
could have pulled ourselves out of this
without too great a sacrifice on the
part of anyone
all that would have been necessary would
have been for us to take an
interest in the domestic affairs of our
nation and to insist that our elected
representatives
merely enforce the laws that were then
on the books to protect us from internal
subversion
and to keep the enemy outside the gates
but we didn't instead
we slept and one by one
those laws were stricken down by the
supreme court
congress failed to repair the damage
and our defenses are no more
now the enemy is inside our gates he is
on our streets
he is in our halls of parliament and now
there is hell to pay our enemy is not
going to leave quietly
just because we suddenly discover him
and ask him to go
hardly the nature of tyranny is such
that
like the bar but an arrow it goes in
easily
but the price of pulling it out
is a piece of flesh now let me be more
specific
before we finally win this battle and i
should hasten to say that there's no
doubt in my mind that we're going to win
i'm increasingly convinced of this but
before we finally do see victory
it's now inevitable that some of us even
in this room
will lose our lives in the communist
revolution
that already is raging around us
i can't tell you who it's going to be of
course but i can tell you
that it'll make no practical difference
whether we're resisting at the time
or whether we're merely trying to hide
most of the casualties will occur
because people just happen to be in the
wrong place
at the wrong time now i mention this
not to suggest that we all grab our guns
and groceries and head to the hills
in many ways this too would be playing
right into the hands of the communists
no i mentioned it for only
one reason and that is to stress the
seriousness of the challenge
that now confronts this nation it's
literally a question of
life and death for all of us and it's
about time the american people began to
face up to that fact and to act
accordingly
i have no idea of what each of you is
going to do
in the critical days that lie ahead it
may be much
it may be little it may be nothing at
all i don't know
only you can answer that question
but ladies and gentlemen whatever it is
you decide to do for your country
do it soon do it now
every minute that you delay further
will add dearly to the price
of ultimate victory
thank you
you
