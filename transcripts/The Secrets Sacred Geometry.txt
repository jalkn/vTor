Ahoy their Beautiful Soul we've got
another really fun one for you today
it's one of the most mind-blowing pieces
of content we've seen in a long time and
it's such an honor to share it with you
this is an exclusive episode from Gaia
called the masters of the net diving
deep into the 40 Years of research by Dr
Robert Gilbert PhD a former nuclear
biological chemical defense Marine Corps
instructor who went through his own
Awakening and became the founder of the
vesica institute for holistic studies
his work as you'll soon see offers a new
way of understanding the invisible
energy Matrix that underlies everything
in the physical world
while the mainstream understanding of
reality has been largely restricted by
the materialistic worldview each day
there is an ever-growing body of
research that suggests that we can
understand the underlying Foundation of
existence in an entirely new way and by
this understanding we may become free to
live harmoniously with ourselves and the
whole world once this episode is
complete if you enjoyed it please check
out the rest of this series on Gaia

definitely worth it
enjoy
[Music]
there is a pattern behind everything in
your life it's pain or pleasure
happiness or misery success or failure
the hidden key to self-empowerment is
the knowledge of these patterns which
direct Our Lives
sacred geometry teaches the master
patterns which create our world and
which are the true secret behind all
manifestation
[Music]
series removes the veils of previously
hidden knowledge you will learn key
subtle energy patterns which when
activated regularly in your own energy
field can change your life
[Music]
welcome I'm your host Dr Robert J
Gilbert founder of the vesica institute
for holistic studies for over 40 years I
have intensively researched the patterns
behind human life
this includes scientific studies from my
time as a U.S Marine Corps instructor in
the field of nuclear biological chemical
warfare defense
and studies of spiritual Traditions
around the world
while completing my PhD in International
Studies
I'm excited to share with you in this
series some of the highlights of these
40 Years of research we will explore
together the hidden patterns which
manifest everything in physical
existence
this is a journey of empowerment
by learning how to work with subtle
energy patterns known to ancient
Traditions you can initiate an
alchemical transformation within
yourself
this process can Empower your individual
evolution of Consciousness and thereby
assist the raising of Consciousness on
our planet
we begin with a hidden lineage of
initiates known in ancient Egypt
as the masters of the net
these initiates knew a great secret that
behind everything in physical existence
is an invisible Matrix of energy
which is the source of all physical
manifestation
it is this invisible energy Matrix which
materializes everything in the physical
world through the patterns we call
sacred geometry
the term sacred geometry is comprised of
Geo meaning Earth and metri meaning
measurement
sacred geometry literally means the
sacred measure of the earth we can also
think of this in a larger sense of
sacred geometry meaning the Divine
blueprints of Consciousness and energy
in the ancient world all of the temples
monuments and political power centers
were built on the larger power spots of
the Earth's energy grid and were used
for establishing the exact placement of
the central axis of the building the
walls the altars and all the other
features in sacred buildings
the Ancients knew that many of these
large-scale Earth grids are connected to
the sacred geometry patterns we know
today as the platonic solids they're
called platonic solids because they
appeared in the writings of Plato 2500
years ago
however these forms were known in
Ancient Temple Sciences long before the
time of Plato
the platonic solids are the geometric
forms which correspond to the four
elements of earth water air and Fire
everything then there is the form of The
Fifth Element the universal life force
which the Greeks called ether and was
known as Chi Ki Prana and other names in
different traditions
this is the fifth and final platonic
solid
this Fifth Element form is the 12-sided
dodecahedron which was considered sacred
and sometimes secret in the Greek
tradition
Plato hints at it when he described the
Earth as looking from above like a
12-sided ball
in ancient Traditions both the earth and
the entire universe were considered to
have the form of a dodecahedron
it's easy to see why over the entrance
to Plato's initiation school there was
said to be a sign which read no one
ignorant of geometry may enter
[Music]
in the 1970s Ivan Sanderson wrote an
article showing the geometric locations
of physical anomalies on the Earth
the most famous of these locations is
the Devil's Triangle around Bermuda
however Sanderson found that there was a
geometric pattern of similar sites all
around the globe
Sanderson found these locations were at
the nodal points of the platonic solid
known as the icosahedron
as we will see in a later episode of
this series The icosahedron is not only
the sacred geometry shape for this part
of the energy grid of the earth it is
also known in science today as a key
biological form which appears for
example in the geometric form of viruses
the most basic form of life
researchers discovered that to make
these Earth grid Maps align properly to
these sacred geometry patterns Point
number one of the grid needed to be
aligned to one of the world's great
large-scale power spots Giza plateau in
Egypt
and so it is here in the civilization of
ancient Egypt built on this primary
power spot of the earth grid that we
will find evidence of an ancient
initiation system based on the invisible
energy grids
which in ancient text are often referred
to as Nets or the net
in India for example
the jeweled net of Indra is described as
a net extending infinitely in all
directions with jewels which glitter
like stars at every nodal point of the
net every Jewel reflects all the other
jewels in itself
other interpretations include that every
bright Jewel at the nodal points of the
net is an Atman which is the spirit core
within human beings and all Spiritual
Beings
each Atman Spirit core has the same
Divine Essence as all others but with
their own unique qualities based on the
karma they have generated through acting
in the physical world
in the highest levels of modern physics
it is understood that physical matter is
based on both physical particles in
different states of vibration and on
waves
waves can collapse into particles
particles can disintegrate back into
waves this is called wave particle
duality in modern physics
similarly ancient Traditions based both
their understanding of natural forces
and their healing methods on Dynamic
vital energy not on the physical matter
itself which is simply a lower denser
manifestation of the underlying energy
patterns ancient Traditions understood
that energy in different states is the
core of all existence
this brings us to an important secret of
sacred geometry
whenever you see a physical form
including the forms of sacred geometry
we will explore in this series don't
think of it as a solid inert structure
always keep in mind that what stands
behind this physical structure is the
net
the vibrational Matrix of energy that
this form crystallized out of
remember that the physical form can
change immediately when the background
energy Matrix changes
everything is energy so sacred geometry
patterns are crystallized forms showing
us the invisible vibrational Matrix
which is the higher reality
this vibrational Matrix is the net which
ancient Traditions learn to master
understanding that the solidity of
physical matter is an illusion that it
can change based on changing the
vibrational Matrix behind matter is the
secret of all Advanced Energy healing
and what we call today vibrational
medicine
it is also the secret of all advanced
spiritual activation of the human being
foreign
these nets are energy grids work on
higher plane levels in addition to their
work on the physical plane to create
physical form
modern physics has allowed materialism
to restrict its understanding of this
larger reality so that modern
materialism only sees energy manifesting
at two levels the electromagnetic and
the physical levels
one of the most popular models of these
higher planes today is the seven planes
model from the theosophical society
this image of the seven planes of nature
is derived from the modern system of
biogeometry developed by Dr Ibrahim
Karim in Cairo Egypt
Dr Karim found the geometric shapes
which connect in resonance to each plane
which makes possible very advanced work
in testing or directing energy to these
planes
we will discuss biogeometry in more
detail in the final episode of this
season
working with higher planes along with
the net of the vibrational Matrix is a
key secret of spiritual initiation
this makes possible Advanced
applications in manifestation Prosperity
work and the materialization of energy
and thought forms into physical reality
it is all about knowing how to work with
the patterns of energy which move from
the higher planes of Consciousness into
vibrational matrices and then
crystallize into physical manifestation
modern materialistic science doesn't
allow itself to consider any planes
above the physical plane it bans any
discussion of metaphysics just as
dogmatically as any fundamentalist
religion enforces the suppression of
heretical ideas
instead modern science talks about
Dimensions rather than higher planes
modern advanced physics is full of
higher dimensions in fact modern physics
requires the existence of many higher
dimensions in order for the mathematics
of quantum physics to work out
but despite these higher dimensions in
physics equations materialistic science
continues to insist that this is simply
a mathematical artifact and does not
indicate the existence of any higher
metaphysical realities
so let's take just a moment to
understand the basics of what dimensions
are as these have taken the place in
physics today of the classical ideas of
the higher planes of existence
physics today teaches that our physical
reality is literally a three-dimensional
geometric grid comprised of three axes
each at a 90 degree angle to the others
we start with zero Dimensions which is a
point in energy center in physics it is
connected to the idea of the singularity
as the source of all creation
in spiritual terms the Zero Dimensional
point is the gateway to the Divine Unity
from which all polarity and
manifestation emerges
which ancient Traditions would call the
Divine plain
the Zero Dimensional point is literally
the spiritual origin point from which
physical space is created
to create the First Dimension
Point moves parallel to itself to create
a line
the point then moves on a new axis
creating lines between the new point and
the two previous points making the
simplest two-dimensional straight line
form the triangle
the point then moves on a new 90 degree
axis which creates not only new lines
between the now four points but also
creates planes on all sides of this now
three-dimensional form
this makes the simplest straight line
three-dimensional geometrical form the
tetrahedron
we have now moved from the point to the
line to the plane to the solid from zero
Dimensions to three dimensions
if we move the point into another new
axis away from the existing three
dimensions of space we then create a
fourth dimensional object
we cannot see any aspect of fourth
dimensional or higher forms because our
human senses are based on perceiving our
three-dimensional world
however it may be that our subtle organs
of spiritual perception
could perceive these higher Dimensions
or higher planes
this realization that beings with sense
organs for only lower Dimensions could
only see fragments of higher dimensional
objects
was the basis for the concept of flat
land by Edwin Abbott
the Flatland concept shows how a
two-dimensional being could only see
simple two-dimensional or
one-dimensional aspects of
three-dimensional objects moving through
the plane of the world that he perceives
the lesson of course is that the same is
true for us as three-dimensional beings
we can only see 3D or lower dimensional
sections of any fourth dimensional or
higher dimensional objects moving
through our world
this flatland concept of our only
perceiving small fragments of higher
dimensional objects moving through our
world opens up new understandings of
mysterious spiritual manifestations of
UFO sightings Etc
Fifth Sixth and even higher dimensional
forums are also possible and have
already been identified in advanced
scientific mathematics and geometric
studies
when we see these higher dimensional
geometric forms on a flat
two-dimensional surface
they appear as a complex grid pattern
the net described in the ancient
traditions
so if we add another point to the
preceding series of dimensional images a
new point which would now be in the
fourth dimension along an axis shift not
perceivable by a three-dimensional
person this would create a fourth
dimensional form of which we would only
see a shadow of it in our dimension
note that the fourth dimensional form at
the end of this sequence when shown in a
lower dimensional projection as a flat
2D form from a specific perspective
looks like a five-pointed star
a pentagram inside a five-sided
enclosure a pentagon this opens up the
possibility that forms and sacred
geometry used in ancient spiritual
traditions
are actually lower dimensional
projection views of higher dimensional
objects
these 2D or 3D sacred geometry patterns
may actually have the hidden power to
energetically connect us to higher
dimensional realities
as we will see in a later episode the
pentagram form we see here created by
higher dimensional projection is a key
sacred geometry pattern for the human
energy body and has been used for
Spiritual and magical purposes
throughout recorded human history
this pentagram within a pentagon is also
related to the large dodecahedron of the
earth grid we saw earlier in this
episode
the dodecahedron is comprised of 12
pentagons showing that the energy
geometries of the human body also exist
in a larger macro form in the energy
grids of the Earth itself
this is a profound aspect of sacred
geometry that geometric forms we see may
just be shadows of higher dimensional
forms which most human beings have not
yet developed a sense organ to perceive
directly
[Music]
we have explored some basics of energy
grids or what the Ancients called the
net as patterns which create the
physical world and which manifest on
multiple planes and dimensions
we can now explore the hidden tradition
of the Masters of the net in ancient
Egypt
the ancient Egyptian tradition
cultivated deep hidden knowledge and
applications of the energetic net behind
all physical manifestation both in the
human energy field and in the Earth
itself
in modern physics it is understood that
all physical matter is within an energy
grid of space and time
today we see in physics books a
representation of the net of space-time
being distorted by physical Mass
this net is often shown looking like a
rubber sheet with a squared geometric
grid on it being distorted and stretched
by an object such as a planet
this means that the net is malleable and
it can be modified
over five thousand years before modern
physics this same energy grid which is
today called the net of space-time was
known and shown in the ancient Egyptian
Mysteries as the net which creates and
sustains all physical existence
learning to tap the power of this
geometric energy grid was a key aspect
of the Egyptian temple initiation
those initiated into these Mysteries
were known as the masters of the net
behind the illustrations on the Egyptian
temple walls were geometric grids
constructed first by the artist before
creating the final illustrations we see
on the completed Temple walls in Egypt
these geometric grids used in ancient
Egypt are known to Modern egyptologists
but with their materialistic Viewpoint
many believe these grids to have only
been a practical method to lay out the
illustrations on the wall they ignored
the vast literature in ancient Egypt
which describes this net and its magical
power
there are specific terms used for
different aspects of the geometric net
of energy by the Egyptian initiates of
the Temple
some of those terms are seen here from
hieroglyphic text published by British
researchers in the late 1800s
there were also direct representations
of the net
for the public the net was often
represented metaphorically as a net used
to catch fish or to catch birds
initiates were shown learning to master
the net and its powers
deeper initiation teachings were also
held within the net imagery
ancient Egyptians did not refer to
non-physical beings as gods or goddesses
as they are translated into English
today from ancient text but rather they
refer to these beings as netters
the conscious forces of nature which the
initiate learns to directly communicate
with and to direct their power
many nectares were shown with animal
heads not because ancient Egyptians
worshiped animals as a sometimes falsely
speculated today
but because they understood that higher
Divine Powers manifested through
specific animals
just as today we say clever as a fox
the ibis-headed nedder was known to the
ancient Egyptians as jehute
but today we know this Netter from the
later corrupted Greek name
thought or Thoth
jehute was understood to be the being
who created and taught the Egyptian
temple science
the non-physical Servants of jehute were
depicted as baboons casting Nets into
water to catch fish
now the deeper initiation knowledge
behind this was that these fish caught
in the net were in actuality The Souls
of the Dead who are unable to
consciously navigate through the
non-physical worlds
and so became caught in the net
there's a specific teaching about this
in the key Egyptian initiation text
called The Book of coming forth into
light
which today we often call the Egyptian
Book of the Dead
in this text the initiate learns to
navigate and master the net
in chapter 153 the initiate learns to
consciously navigate through the net as
seen in this quote
OU fishermen you shall not catch me in
your net you shall not catch me in your
Nets in which you catch the unwary for I
know the net from its upper Heights to
its lowered depths
this remarkable initiation text details
all of the aspects of the net from the
earth out into cosmological bodies and
which aspects of the net connect a
specific higher non-physical beings the
netters
the true Master of the net is the
initiate who has learned how to navigate
through the net and learn how to use the
net of the living energy Matrix behind
everything on the physical plane to
develop powers that the uninitiated
consider it to be magical
in ancient Egypt the neter of death and
rebirth was named azra
a name later corrupted in Greek to
become Osiris
the sacred geometry Forum known as the
backbone of azra in ancient Egypt was
the Jed pillar which was erected each
year in the raising of the Jed ceremony
to connect Heaven and Earth
just as the Egyptian temples connected
power spots on the earth on which they
were built to power spots in the heavens
and just as the human spine stands
direct for us to be held between Earth
and Heaven to act on the physical plane
the raising of the Jed pillar was the
culmination of the mysteries of azra or
Osiris
in the ancient Egyptian document which
is today known as the West Cara Papyrus
one of the highest masters of the net in
ancient Egypt is described as the Jedi
based on the Jed pillar being the
backbone of azra connecting Heaven and
Earth
the Jedi derives extraordinary powers
from using the net to control Natural
Forces
one story in the west car Papyrus
describes a master of the net a high
priest for a pharaoh snofaru who Parts
the Waters of a lake making a part of a
lake dry
so that a valuable piece of jewelry can
be reclaimed from its floor
foreign
with The Parting of the Red Sea by Moses
described in the Old Testament
however these abilities to control
natural forces were in fact a part of
the Masters of the net initiation
lineage from which Moses derived his
knowledge during his training in the
Egyptian temples
similarly the use of the staff by Moses
is directly derived from the training
and the use of the staff in the Egyptian
temples
the staff access an antenna
for detecting and projecting higher
forces based on the designs and shapes
on the staff
in the west car Papyrus after the story
of the priest who Parts the waters for
the pharaoh
the story of the Jedi is introduced he
is said in this ancient Egyptian text to
specifically have the power to restore
life to the dead and to know hidden
secrets of the ancient temples the term
used in recent times in the Star Wars
film series of a Jedi Knight who can
direct the force
thus carries a powerful subconscious
resonance and attraction for people
today
this is because it comes from the hakao
system of Words of Power in ancient
Egypt specifically the terms Jed and
Jedi
the lightsaber in Star Wars sometimes
resembles the form of the Jed pillar as
well
from ancient Egypt the hidden knowledge
of the net spread to other cultures in
the western tradition as well
the foundation of the western
monotheistic tradition is the Old
Testament
whose first book Genesis describes the
creation of the Earth from higher
spiritual Realms through the use of
specific sacred geometry patterns the
very first statement in Genesis in
Hebrew is bareshit note that in the
Hebrew original text there are no
divisions of the letters into words just
an unbroken stream of letters which can
be divided and interpreted in deeper
ways within the kabbalistic Mysteries
bereshit is usually translated into
English as meaning in the beginning
but in the deeper kabbalistic teachings
it also literally means the net or God
creates the net as the beginning of
creation
this means that the same geometric
energy net we saw previously as the core
of ancient Egyptian initiation which
appears as the Matrix of space-time and
modern physics is also the very first
statement of Genesis which can be
accurately translated as God creates the
net as the very first Act of Creation
the Jewish tradition is well known for
avoiding visual images of divine
realities however in the Kabbalah there
is a powerful discussion of a specific
net of creation manifested by the 22
flame letters of the Hebrew alphabet
Each of which is a divine power
in the modern Jewish Kabbalah this net
pattern is referred to as the 231 Gates
perhaps the best known net pattern from
the Jewish tradition in modern times is
the Tree of Life
an energy Matrix which is a map
connecting multiple Dimensions which
also microcosmically manifest as a
powerful energy grid within the human
energy body
methods to activate this powerful energy
grid within our human energy field
require real knowledge about this
pattern and its effects
rather than the inaccurate speculation
which has become so prevalent in recent
times
sloth's knowledge was restored in Modern
Times by a Greek Christian healer and
initiate known to the public as daskalos
who referred to the pattern as the
symbol of life from its ancient Egyptian
roots
activating each key part of this net
grid pattern requires regular practice
we will show you a simplified method
where you will activate this pattern one
section at a time
so that by the end of this series you
will have learned how to activate the
full pattern in your energy field
Please be aware that this can be an
extremely powerful practice which can
accelerate your path of personal
Evolution and can even beneficially
transform your spiritual destiny
we will in this series refer to this
powerful sacred geometry Grid in the
human energy field as the grid of Life
design
or refer to in short by the acronym gold
this will help to remind us that this
pattern is indeed linked to activating
the gold energy of the Saints in our
energy field
the same golden Radiance which is shown
above the heads or bodies of the great
initiates of every spiritual tradition
around the world
[Music]
so let us begin our activation of the
grid of Life design or gold with the
activation of the gold energy
surrounding our head the seat of our
consciousness
if you'd like to do the practice now
please see the companion video for this
episode
otherwise please set an intention to
come back and do the practice at a later
time
and join us for our next episode where
we will reveal four of the deepest
Secrets within sacred geometry
we'll Explore More Of The Core hidden
knowledge of the Masters of the net from
Egypt and from other great initiation
Traditions around the world see you then
